This is a simple MSC done in Smalltalk.


== Objects and their relationship ==

=== MSC ===
 - MSC has a VLR, HLR, BSCConfig, MSCBSCConnectionHandler
 - MSC can serve a BSC on TCP depending on the MSCConfig with
   the BSCListener

=== BSCListener ===
 - BSCListener will wait for incoming connections and hand them
   to the MSCBSCConnectionHandlerMSC. This will try to find the
   configured peer and might do the connection.

=== MSCBSCConnectionHandler ===
  - Get's a new connection from the BSCListener, will fork and
    serve the BSC using the BSCIPAConnection. This is done to
    remember if a given system is already connected or not.

=== BSCIPAConnection ===
  - Handles IPA mux/demux on the socket...
  - Has a SCCPHandler
  - Uses GSMProcessor to process the GSM part of it.

=== GSMProcessor ===
  - Handles GSM connections, transaction and such.
